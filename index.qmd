## Materials

All the materials we'll use today are in this RStudio project. You can open this project in your browser without needing to install or download anything on your computer. Open this Posit.cloud project (you'll need to create a free account really quick):

Alternatively, you can download all the files to your computer. It is a `.zip` file, so make sure you extract/unzip it after downloading it (especially if [you're using Windows!](https://evalsp24.classes.andrewheiss.com/resource/unzipping.html))
